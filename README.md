# malware_archive_site
REST API to archive metadata about collected malware

This is the assumed central metadata store for all the pieces of collected malware in the system. 

The assumed workflow is basically an ETL pipeline:
    
 * collector gets a collection of files in zip (or individual file from pastebin)
 * collector writes file to RAID
 * if it's an individual file with many entries across a day (like pastebin):
   * a separate archiver job collects the individual files together into a batch, and it performs next step as collector
 * collector (or archiver) posts path of zip to analyzer
 * analyzer gets metadata about each file in zip archive  and the zip archive itself
 * analyzer posts Archive to malware_archive_site (this app), gets ID of it from post
 * analyzer posts Files that are in Archive, gets ID of them from post
 * analyzer posts Metadata, VT Results, FileInfo using ID of the File
