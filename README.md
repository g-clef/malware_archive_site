# malware_archive_site
REST API to archive metadata about collected malware

This is the assumed central metadata store for all the pieces of collected malware in the system. 

The assumed workflow is basically an ETL pipeline:
    
 * data source gets a collection of files in zip (or individual files)
 * source writes file to RAID
 * if the source collects individual files across a day (like pastebin), then a separate collector job collects the 
   individual files together into a batch, and zips those.
 * source (or collector if above line was true) posts path of zip to analyzer
 * analyzer gets metadata about each file in zip archive and the zip archive itself
 * analyzer posts Archive to malware_archive_site (this app), gets ID of it from post
 * analyzer posts Files that are in Archive, gets ID of them from post
 * analyzer posts Metadata, VT Results (if enabled), FileInfo using ID of the File
